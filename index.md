## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/cayce-pollard/cayce-pollard.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

I am generally interested in complex systems science that cuts across the traditional disciplinary boundaries. My research aims at understanding how collective behaviors emerge in systems with many interacting entities. Specifically, I am currently interested in complex networks, social networks, opinion dynamics, biological systems, network epidemiology, computational linguistics, and magnetic systems.
As a scientist working with public-funded research,  it is my responsibility to pay back to society by promoting public awareness of science and contributing to science education.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/cayce-pollard/cayce-pollard.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
